# Scripts for Maya

These scripts were originally written for Maya 2012 in python.

*   CameraMovementScale: Change the rotation, pan and zoom speed of the maya viewport camera
*   Maya2UnityExporter: Exports the current scene as an .fbx, with textures, to a Unity assets directory with the same naming convention as the current Maya Scene. Can freeze (non-deformer) transforms, deletes history, centers pivots, etc, and version up the current Maya Scene on export. Dialog settings are saved in an xml file.
